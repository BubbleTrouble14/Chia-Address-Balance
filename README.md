# Chia-Address-Balance

A React Native application which works both on Android and Apple, to show ones Chia wallet balance. It requires no private data at all. It just uses the data from https://www.chiaexplorer.com/ which is public to everyone.

It's still very much in beta, still requires more testing.
I do plan to add more features. But nothing which needs any private data.
